There are two Playgrounds, one for
[vanilla OCaml](https:////bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo),
the other for
[Facebook Reason](https:////bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/reason-demo)

Note that the playgrounds are only for demos, it might not be the latest,
you should always use the command line as your production tools.
