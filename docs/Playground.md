There are two Playgrounds, one for
[vanilla OCaml](https:////bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo),
the other for
[Facebook Reason](https:////bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/reason-demo)

Note that the playgrounds are only for demos and might not be the latest.
You should always use the command line as your production tool.
