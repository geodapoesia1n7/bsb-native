Notes to myself on all the steps to make for a Ninja release.

1. git checkout release; git merge master
2. fix version number in source (it will likely conflict in the above)
3. fix version in doc/manual.asciidoc
4. grep doc/manual.asciidoc for XXX, fix version references
5. rebuild manual, put in place on website
6. commit, tag, push
7. construct release notes from prior notes
