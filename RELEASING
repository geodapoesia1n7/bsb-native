Notes to myself on all the steps to make for a Ninja release.

1. git checkout release; git merge master
2. fix version number in source (it will likely conflict in the above)
3. fix version in doc/manual.asciidoc
4. rebuild manual, put in place on website
5. commit, tag, push
6. construct release notes from prior notes
