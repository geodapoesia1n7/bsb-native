Generating the docs:
  sudo apt-get install asciidoc --no-install-recommends
  ./ninja doc

Adjusting build flags:
  Just a hack, but edit config.ninja (which was generated by bootstrap.sh)
  to turn on debugging symbols.

Test-driven development:
  Set your build command to
    ./ninja ninja_test && ./ninja_test --gtest_filter=MyTest.Name
  now you can repeatedly run that while developing until the tests pass.
  Remember to build "all" before committing to verify the other source
  still works!
