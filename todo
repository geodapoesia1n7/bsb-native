save command lines
"explain" mode that shows why we're building a file
"one file" mode that builds only outputs of a single file

short-term ideas:
- magic $in/$out variables shouldn't be magic, they're just a shortcut
  for specifying commands like
    rule frob
      command = frob $manual_inputs
    build foo: frob
      manual_inputs = a b c

longer-term ideas:

- use lemon/ragel for parsing

- progress bar rather than printing commands in series

- store historical timing info, allowing etas on builds
