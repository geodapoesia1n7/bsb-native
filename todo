save command lines
parse c header deps
parallization

longer-term ideas:

- bootstrap -- output a shell script that builds everything serially

- use lemon/ragel for parsing

- buffer stderr from commands, only print failing commands/output

- progress bar rather than printing commands in series

- store historical timing info, allowing etas on builds
