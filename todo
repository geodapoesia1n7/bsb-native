save command lines
  or use mtimes on build files?
"explain" mode that shows why we're building a file
"one file" mode that builds only outputs of a single file
adjust to system load dynamically

progress bar rather than printing commands in series
store historical timing info, allowing etas on builds
  how does parallelization fit in?
