save command lines
  or use mtimes on build files?
"explain" mode that shows why we're building a file
"one file" mode that builds only outputs of a single file
"dry run" mode that shows command lines but doesn't build
adjust to system load dynamically

progress bar rather than printing commands in series
store historical timing info, allowing etas on builds
  how does parallelization fit in?
