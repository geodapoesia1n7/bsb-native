if command line for an output changed, no need to even stat
the output, just mark it for rebuilding immediately.

delete halfway-built output files when interrupted

"explain" mode that shows why we're building a file
"one file" mode that builds only outputs of a single file
adjust to system load dynamically

progress bar rather than printing commands in series
store historical timing info, allowing etas on builds
  how does parallelization fit in?
