support parsing subfiles
save command lines
parallization

bootstrap: write a shell script that is just does
  gcc -o ninja $(ls *.cc)
  ./ninja ninja


longer-term ideas:

- use lemon/ragel for parsing

- buffer stderr from commands, only print failing commands/output

- progress bar rather than printing commands in series

- store historical timing info, allowing etas on builds
