Ninja is a small build system closest in spirit to Make.

See the manual -- http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html or
manual.asciidoc included in the distribution -- for more background,
including motivation and build instructions.

Though the code is copyright Google, don't take that as an
endorsement; I wrote this in my spare time for fun.
