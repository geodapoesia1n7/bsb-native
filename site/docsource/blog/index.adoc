# Announcing BuckleScript 1.0

https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript[BuckleScript] is an optimizing compiler which compiles http://ocaml.org/[OCaml]
into JavaScript module by module _without name mangling_. The generated code is _highly readable_ and _super small_,
see http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/[Hello world] example
and http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/#Use_JS_standard_Library_WIP[examples of calling JS libraries].
BuckleScript is strongly inspired by TypeScript, BabelJS - we consider _readability_ and _easy integration with existing JS libraries_ to be essential.

There are a few things we believe BuckleScript does  better compared with TypeScript:


More type safe and more efficient code generated::

  BuckleScript is not a new language, it is OCaml. OCaml offers an industrial-strength
  state-of-the-art type system and provides very strong type inference (i.e. unlike TypeScript, no
  verbose type annotation is required), which proves
  http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036[invaluable] in managing large projects. +
  OCaml's type system is not just for tooling; it is a _sound_ type system which means it is guaranteed there will
  be no runtime type errors after type checking. Based on this guarantee, BuckleScript provides many optimizations during offline
  compilation. You can view a simple benchmark https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript#bucklescript-ocaml-stdlib[here]!

All the benefits of OCaml  with a feature rich and efficient FFI::

  Your program can be compiled into  _native code_, _JS_ and even a https://mirage.io/[unikernel]. The BuckleScript compiler is expected to become even faster and produce even faster code owing to https://blogs.janestreet.com/flambda/[more] and https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/606[more] optimizations in the upstream OCaml compiler. +
  Thanks to OCaml's native support of the Object structural type system, BuckleScript's FFI(foreign function interface) can model JS objects natively.
  Some powerful type system features like http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual006.html#toc36[polymorphic variants] and http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual021.html#toc85[GADTs] are also invaluable in modeling existing JS libraries. +
  Unlike most language FFIs, the design goal of http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#\_ocaml\_calling\_js[BuckleScript FFI] is to avoid writing any unsafe JS "stub" code with a performance cost.
  In particular, we try to avoid any unnecessary memory allocations in the FFI.

Compilation speed is key to a good developer experience::

  Our internal benchmarks shows that BuckleScript compiles at least 10x faster than TypeScript.
  There is no magic here, the BuckleScript compiler is written in OCaml which is
  compiled to blazing fast native code. +
  However, it does not limit the availability of BuckleScript compiler:
  it is also compiled to a JS file (gzipped: 700KB for pure OCaml + 300KB for https://github.com/facebook/reason/[Reason] support). +
  http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/[The playground] is powered by the compiler compiled to JS, which demonstrates a nearly real-time compilation speed, imagine how fast the native compiler would be.



We are pleased to announce a stable 1.0 release of BuckleScript, which covers the whole OCaml language (except some features highly coupled with runtime, like the Gc and Unix modules etc.).
