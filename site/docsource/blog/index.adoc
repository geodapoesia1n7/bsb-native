'''

BuckleScript is an optimizing compiler which compiles http://ocaml.org/[OCaml]
into JavaScript module by module without name mangling.

The generated code is highly readable and very small, see http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/[Hello world] example
and http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/#Use_JS_standard_Library(WIP)[examples of calling JS libraries]
