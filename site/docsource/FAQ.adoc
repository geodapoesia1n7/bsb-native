== Frequently Asked Questions

[qanda]

The compiler does not build?::
  In production mode, the compiler is a single file in
`jscomp/bin/compiler.ml`. If it is not compiling, make sure you have the
right OCaml compiler version. Currently the OCaml compiler is a
submodule of BuckleScript. Make sure the exact commit hash matches (we
only update the compiler occasionally).

Which version of JavaScript syntax does BuckleScript target?::
BuckleScript targets **ES5**.

What polyfills does BuckleScript need?::

- _Math.imul_:
  This polyfill is needed for `int32` multiplication.
  BuckleScript provides this by default(when feature detection returns false), no action is
  required from the user.
- _TypedArray_:
  The TypedArray polyfill is not provided by BuckleScript and it's the
  responsibility of the user to bundle the desired polyfill implementation
  with the BuckleScript generated code.

  The following functions from OCaml stdlib
  require the TypedArray polyfill:

    * Int64.float_of_bits
    * Int64.bits_of_float
    * Int32.float_of_bits
    * Int32.bits_of_float

[WARNING]
=====

For the current BuckleScript version, if the user does not bundle the
TypedArray polyfill, the JavaScript engine does not support it and user used
functions mentioned above, the code will fail at runtime.
