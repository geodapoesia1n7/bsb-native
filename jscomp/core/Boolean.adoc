# Why boolean is not transparent when

1. printing
[source,ocaml]
--------------
Js.log true
--------------

2. pattern match
[source,ocaml]
--------------
let f x y = 
  match x,y with
  | true, false -> 0
--------------

3. comparison
[source,ocaml]
--------------
if v = true then

# Where JS boolean could be introduced 

JS operatons which could generate JS booleans
- `not`
- Equality comparison

`and`, `or` is fine
In JS, `and`, `or` is untyped, but it is a superset of OCaml semantics:

[source,js]
-----------
x && y 
/* equivalent to  */ 
x ? x : y
-----------

There is no coersion so `1&&0`, `1&&1`, `0&&1`, `0&&0` are all the same as JS version.
Same for `or`

but `not` is not the same as `!`, `!` will do the conversion to enforce its result is JS boolean
