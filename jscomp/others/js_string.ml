type t = string

(** [make value] converts the given value to a string

@example {[

  make [|1;2;3|]) = "1,2,3";;
]}
*)
external make : 'a -> t = "String" [@@bs.val]

(** [fromCharCode n]
  creates a string containing the character corresponding to that number; {i n} ranges from 0 to 65535. If out of range, the lower 16 bits of the value are used. Thus, [fromCharCode 0x1F63A] gives the same result as [fromCharCode 0xF63A].

@example {[
  fromCharCode 65 = "A";;
  fromCharCode 0x3c8 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;
  fromCharCode 0xd55c = {js|í•œ|js};;
  fromCharCode -64568 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;
]}

external fromCharCodeMany : int array -> t = "String.fromCharCode" [@@bs.val] [@@bs.splice]
(** [fromCharCodeMany \[|n1;n2;n3|\]] creates a string from the characters corresponding to the given numbers, using the same rules as [fromCharCode].

@example {[
  fromCharCodeMany([|0xd55c, 0xae00, 33|]) = {js|í•œê¸€!|js};;
]}
*)

(** [fromCodePoint n]
  creates a string containing the character corresponding to that numeric code point. If the number is not a valid code point, {b raises} [RangeError]. Thus, [fromCodePoint 0x1F63A] will produce a correct value, unlike [fromCharCode 0x1F63A], and [fromCodePoint -5] will raise a [RangeError].
  
@example {[
  fromCodePoint 65 = "A";;
  fromCodePoint 0x3c8 = {js|Ïˆ|js};;
  fromCodePoint 0xd55c = {js|í•œ|js};;
  fromCodePoint 0x1f63a = {js|ðŸ˜º|js};;
]}

*)
external fromCodePoint : int -> t = "String.fromCodePoint" [@@bs.val] (** ES2015 *)

(** [fromCharCodeMany \[|n1;n2;n3|\]] creates a string from the characters corresponding to the given code point numbers, using the same rules as [fromCodePoint].

@example {[

(** [length s] returns the length of the given string.

@example {[
  length "abcd" = 4;;
]}

*)
external length : t -> int = "" [@@bs.get]

(** [get s n] returns as a string the character at the given index number. If [n] is out of range, this function returns [undefined], so at some point this function may be modified to return [t option].

@example {[
  get "Reason" 0 = "R";;
  get "Reason" 4 = "o";;
  get {js|Ráº½asÃ¶Å„|js} 5 = {js|Å„|js};;
]}
*)
external get : t -> int -> t = "" [@@bs.get_index]

(** [charAt n s] gets the character at index [n] within string [s]. If [n] is negative or greater than the length of [s], returns the empty string. If the string contains characters outside the range [\u0000-\uffff], it will return the first 16-bit value at that position in the string.

@example {[
  charAt 0, "Reason" = "R"
  charAt( 12, "Reason") = "";
  charAt( 5, {js|Ráº½asÃ¶Å„|js} = {js|Å„|js}
]}
*)
external charAt : int ->  t = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(** [charCodeAt n s] returns the character code at position [n] in string [s]; the result is in the range 0-65535, unlke [codePointAt], so it will not work correctly for characters with code points greater than or equal to [0x10000].
The return type is [float] because this function returns [NaN] if [n] is less than zero or greater than the length of the string.

@example {[
  charCodeAt 0 {js|ðŸ˜º|js} returns 0xd83d
  codePointAt 0 {js|ðŸ˜º|js} returns Some 0x1f63a
]}

*)
external charCodeAt : int -> float  = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(** [codePointAt n s] returns the code point at position [n] within string [s] as a [Some] value. The return value handles code points greater than or equal to [0x10000]. If there is no code point at the given position, the function returns [None].

@example {[
  codePointAt 1 {js|Â¿ðŸ˜º?|js} = Some 0x1f63a
  codePointAt 5 "abc" = None
]}
*)
external codePointAt : int -> int option = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] [@@bs.return {undefined_to_opt}] (** ES2015 *)

(** [concat append original] returns a new string with [append] added after [original].

  @example {[
    concat "bell" "cow" = "cowbell";;
  ]}

*)
external concat : t -> t = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(** [concat arr original] returns a new string consisting of each item of an array of strings added to the [original] string.

  @example {[
    concatMany [|"2nd"; "3rd"; "4th"|] "1st" = "1st2nd3rd4th";;
  ]}
*)

(** ES2015:
    [endsWith substr str] returns [true] if the [str] ends with [substr], [false] otherwise.

      endsWith "Script" "COBOL" = false;;
    ]} 
*)
external endsWith : t -> bool = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] 

(** [endsWithFrom ending len str] returns [true] if the first [len] characters of [str] end with [ending], [false] otherwise. If [n] is greater than or equal to the length of [str], then it works like [endsWith]. (Honestly, this should have been named [endsWithAt], but oh well.)

  @example {[
    endsWithFrom "cd" 4 "abcd" = true;;
    endsWithFrom "cd" 3 "abcde" = false;;
    endsWithFrom "cde" 99 "abcde" = true;;
    endsWithFrom "ple" 7 "example.dat" = true;;
  ]}

  includes "er" "programmer" = true;;
  includes "pro" "programmer" = true;;
  includes "xyz" "programmer" = false;;
]}
*)
external includes : t -> bool = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] (** ES2015 *)

(**
  [includes searchValue start s] returns [true] if [searchValue] is found anywhere within [s] starting at character number [start] (where 0 is the first character), [false] otherwise.
  
@example {[
  includesFrom "gram" 1 "programmer" = true;;
  includesFrom "gram" 4 "programmer" = false;;
  includesFrom {js|í•œ|js} 1 {js|ëŒ€í•œë¯¼êµ­|js} = true;;
]}
*)
external includesFrom : t -> int -> bool = "includes" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] (** ES2015 *)

(**
  [indexOf searchValue s] returns the position at which [searchValue] was first found within [s], or [-1] if [searchValue] is not in [s].
  
@example {[
  indexOf "ok" "bookseller" = 2;;
  indexOf "sell" "bookseller" = 4;;
  indexOf "ee" "beekeeper" = 1;;
  indexOf "xyz" "bookseller" = -1;;
]}
*)
external indexOf : t -> int = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [indexOfFrom searchValue start s] returns the position at which [searchValue] was found within [s] starting at character position [start], or [-1] if [searchValue] is not found in that portion of [s]. The return value is relative to the beginning of the string, no matter where the search started from.
  
@example {[
  indexOfFrom "ok" 1 "bookseller" = 2;;
  indexOfFrom "sell" 2 "bookseller" = 4;;
  indexOfFrom "sell" 5 "bookseller" = -1;;
  indexOf "xyz" "bookseller" = -1;;
]}
*)
external indexOfFrom : t -> int -> int = "indexOf" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [lastIndexOf searchValue s] returns the position of the {i last} occurrence of [searchValue] within [s], searching backwards from the end of the string. Returns [-1] if [searchValue] is not in [s]. The return value is always relative to the beginning of the string.
  
@example {[
  lastIndexOf "ok" "bookseller" = 2;;
  lastIndexOf "ee" "beekeeper" = 4;;
  lastIndexOf "xyz" "abcdefg" = -1;;
]}
*)
external lastIndexOf : t -> int = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [lastIndexOfFrom searchValue start s] returns the position of the {i last} occurrence of [searchValue] within [s], searching backwards from the given [start] position. Returns [-1] if [searchValue] is not in [s]. The return value is always relative to the beginning of the string.
  
@example {[
  lastIndexOfFrom "ok" 6 "bookseller" = 2;;
  lastIndexOfFrom "ee" 8 "beekeeper" = 4;;
  lastIndexOfFrom "ee" 3 "beekeeper" = 1;;
  lastIndexOfFrom "xyz" 4 "abcdefg" = -1;;
]}
*)
external lastIndexOfFrom : t -> int -> int = "lastIndexOf" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]


(* extended by ECMA-402 *)
(**
  [localeCompare comparison reference] returns
  
{ul
  {- a negative value if [reference] comes before [comparison] in sort order}
  {- zero if [reference] and [comparison] have the same sort order}
  {- a positive value if [reference] comes after [comparison] in sort order}}
  
@example {[

  (localeCompare "zebra" "ant") < 0.0;;
  (localeCompare "cat" "cat") = 0.0;;
  (localeCompare "cat" "CAT") > 0.0;; 
]}
*)
external localeCompare : t -> float = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t]

(**
  [match regexp str] matches a string against the given [regexp]. If there is no match, it returns [None].
  For regular expressions without the [g] modifier, if there is a match, the return value is [Some array] where the array contains:
  
  {ul
    {- The entire matched string}
    {- Any capture groups if the [regexp] had parentheses}
  }
  
  For regular expressions with the [g] modifier, a matched expression returns [Some array] with all the matched substrings and no capture groups.
  
@example {[

  match [%re "/b[aeiou]t/g"] "The better bats" = Some [|"bet";"bat"|]
  match [%re "/(\\d+)-(\\d+)-(\\d+)/"] "Today is 2018-04-05." =

(** [normalize str] returns the normalized Unicode string using Normalization Form Canonical (NFC) Composition.

Consider the character [Ã£], which can be represented as the single codepoint [\u00e3] or the combination of a lower case letter A [\u0061] and a combining tilde [\u0303]. Normalization ensures that both can be stored in an equivalent binary representation.

(**
  [repeat n s] returns a string that consists of [n] repetitions of [s]. Raises [RangeError] if [n] is negative.
  
@example {[
  repeat 3 "ha" = "hahaha"
  repeat 0 "empty" = ""
]}
*)
external repeat : int -> t = "" [@@bs.send.pipe: t] (** ES2015 *)

(** [replace substr newSubstr string] returns a new string which is
identical to [string] except with the first matching instance of [substr]
replaced by [newSubstr].

[substr] is treated as a verbatim string to match, not a regular
expression.

@example {[
