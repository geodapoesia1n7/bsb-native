# Phony targets

.default
All  output (not just js in case we support native build)

.install

It's hard to bake it in built rules, since it is flag dependent, if you have `-bin-annot` 
then you would like to install `cmt` too, however, it might be or not be there 
 
# post-build

Here we have `js` generated, we can do either post-build or
create a new rule.

Note creating new rules will get more concurrency while post-build is easy 
and can do in source modification
